Deus-Ex-Machina
===============

Have you ever wanted a mod in minecraft where you can reproduce the greatest achievments of human kind in the 20th and 21st century? 

A mod that rewards you for building epic dams, windmills and coal plants?
Rewards you for exploring and building houses, farms and castles?
Gives you the option to solve your problems by a variety of means and liberates your creativity from
the chore of monotonous crafting systems?

Deus Ex Machina, or god in the machine, is a mod that seeks to fulfill your ambitions.
You will have the opportunity to build realistic machines to process your mineral wealth,
workshops to assemble your creations, people to feed, cloth and defend.
There will be cities, fortresses and farms, powerful explosives to shape and mine the terrain,
and epic creations that dwarf everything that came before them!

The opportunities are endless.

Deus Ex Machina is firmly rooted in a realistic world of ores, plant life, electrical, 
mechanical and chemical principles and the systems that grew from an understanding of these things.

Hundreds of hours of research have gone into learning and reading about human history for this to have been 
made possible.

What constraints minecraft placed upon the ability to accuratly portray this history was the only reason 
anything was changed.

In many cases ideas are abstracted for programmings sake but beyond that you will find the mod to be as
educational as it is entertaining.

By default Deus ex machina will not interfere with other mods or vanilla game features, however, the mod is intended
to be played as a tech mod by itself. Options to disable some of the vanilla game are intended to be activated as well.
